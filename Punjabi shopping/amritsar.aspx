            Guru Amardas decided to construct a tank after he purchased this land from Emperor Akbar. The construction was completed by Guru Ramdas after the death of Guru Amardas. He is also known as Guru Chak or Chak Ramdas. Some of the oldest markets of Amritsar like Guru Ka Bazaar belong to this period. Guru Arjan Dev started the construction of the Holy Temple and Guru Hargobind imparted a martial mind set to the religion. The Akal Takhat was built in 1606. With a rich historical background, Amritsar has various historical as well as mythical narratives like the Ramayana. Ram Tirath, Maharish Valmiki’s ashram, is believed to be situated here.

The Jallianwala Bagh is till date the most prominent monument to India’s struggle for freedom. The Khalsa College was responsible for turning Amritsar into an educational hub.
