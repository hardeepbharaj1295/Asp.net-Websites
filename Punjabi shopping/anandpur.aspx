    <h1><b>Anandpur Sahib</b></h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
    It is believed that many thousands of years ago, the zone of Anandpur was inhabited by wild animals as the place where there was nothing but miles and miles of bushes and forests. It is only by the late 15th century that the animals disappeared and people started making homes here. Anandpur town was established by the ninth guru of the Sikhs, Guru Tegh Bahadur, in 1665. The efforts of the Guru and his followers helped turn the no-man’s land into a place ideal for human habitation. Guru Tegh Bahadur also helped in establishing the Chakk Nanaki, named after his mother, on the top of the Makhowal hillock. Chakk Nanaki soon developed into a center for learning spiritualism and arts. The place later came to be known as Anandpur Sahib.

    <h3><b>Kesar Sahib</b></h3>
<p>
Located atop a hill, Kesar Sahib is a gurudwara of high religious significance in Anandpur Sahib and also the biggest, in terms of size and significance. Also called the Takth Kesar Sahib, it is an important seat of authority of the Sikh religion. The imposing white structure qualifies as a key landmark of this region. The huge religious significance of the place comes from the fact that it was here that Guru Gobind Singh first talked about the tenets of Khalsa and the initiation of the Panch Pyares took place.

<h3><b>Gurudwara Guru-Ka-Mahal</b></h3>
<p>
Known as Bhora Sahib, this was the residence of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur and was later inherited by Sri Guru Gobind Singh. The Sahibzadas or the sons of the 10th Guru were born here. There is an underground room cut off from the main area where the 9th Guru of the Sikhs meditated.
