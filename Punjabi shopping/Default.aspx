       <h1><b>Punjab Histroy</b></h1> 
			<p>
        The word Punjab means, “Land of five rivers”.
         The state has got this name because of the presence of rivers Beas, Ravi, Sutlej,
          Chenab and Jhelum that flow into it. Though the area of the state is small, it is one 
          of the richest in the country. The three main divisions into which the state is categorized 
          into are Doaba, Malwa and Majha. Agriculture is the predominant profession here because of
           the healthy soil and immense water supply.
        <br />
        Punjab is a place that has witnessed the evolution of various religions which explains the culturally diverse
         population found in the state. Sikhism is the main religion here, but there has also been lots of Buddhist
          and Islam movements in the past here. This state is a perfect mix of the rural beauty and urban progress.
           There are lots of architecturally sophisticated Gurudwaras in the state which attracts many tourists who
            are non-Sikhs. The most famous Gurudwara, the Golden Temple, is at Amritsar. The dome made of gold and
             the image of the beautiful shrine falling on the waters of the holy lake within the shrine is a captivating 
             sight, which is why thousands of people visit this temple very year. Other reputed places of worship are
              Sri Anandpur Sahib, Damdama Sahib and Goindwal Sahib.
              <br />
              One place that gives rise to various pent-up emotions and dark memories of the arrogant British rule is
               the Jallianwalah Bagh at Amritsar - a place that occupies an important place in the Indian freedom 
               struggle as it was here that thousands of innocent Sikhs were shot dead by General Dyer.
               <br />
      When it comes to folk culture, there is hardly any state that could beat Punjab. 
      The state is so colourful because of its popular Bhangra dance and music. Baisakhi festival is celebrated with 
      lots of joy, sharing, music, dance and positive energy, as this marks the arrival of the spring season in Punjab.
       Bhangra dance is an important element of this festival and this dance is popular all over the world today though
        it has undergone some changes in the style. The dance was mainly to depict a farmer’s movement while he is at
         his job. Other important festivals here are Lohri, Basant and Teej. The age told Punjabi story telling 
         tradition of Kissa is now adopted in countries like Iran and Afghanistan as well.
         <br />
         Punjabi women wear attractive “Phulkari” dresses on important festivals and occasions. These dresses contain
          the traditional embroidery of Phulkari, which is very famous in Punjab. Phul means flower and Kari means 
          technique or art. Therefore, Phulkari refers to the art of making flowers on dresses.
