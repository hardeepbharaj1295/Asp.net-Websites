    <h1><b>Emergency Numbers</b></h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
 Emergencies can strike any time. Therefore, people must be well-prepared to handle these emergencies so that the loss can be minimised to a great extent. In most of the cases, huge loss occurs mainly because people panic during a crisis. In Punjab, there is remote possibility of panic, because the emergency numbers that people need to contact during a crisis is published across all public places so that the people are well-aware of the same. Ambulance, medical care, fire services, police personnel help, pharmacy and other such similar services provide a list of their helpline numbers to the people, so that instant support can be provided during a crisis.
